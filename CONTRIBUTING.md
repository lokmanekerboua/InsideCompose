Provide a clear and descriptive title.
Include steps to reproduce, expected and actual behavior, and screenshots/code snippets if applicable.
Tag your issue (bug, enhancement, question).
2. Code Style Guide
Use Kotlin coding conventions.
Prefer Jetpack Compose idioms (e.g., stateless composables, proper state hoisting).
Keep code modular and readable.
Document public classes, functions, and Compose components.
Use meaningful commit messages: fix:, feat:, docs:, etc.

Reference related issues (Fixes #123).
Ensure your code builds and passes tests.
Avoid large PRs; split into smaller, focused changes if possible.
Respond to code review feedback.
4. Testing
Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
Use Jetpack Compose testing for UI components.
Ensure tests are deterministic and clearly named.
Run tests locally before pushing.
5. Best Practices for Kotlin & Jetpack Compose
Prefer immutable state whenever possible.
Use @Composable functions for UI.
Avoid blocking calls in composables.
Leverage Android SDK elements and third-party libraries responsibly.
Follow recommended patterns for activities, navigation, and state management.
